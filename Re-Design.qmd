I want to make a bad graph better using what I know. I aim to create a perfect and easily understandable graph. Additionally, I plan to visualize the data in various graphs to check if any new information emerges beyond my current understanding.

**The SAS website gave me the original data for "Immigrant Visa Number Use by Category Fiscal Year 2014:**

##### Fig1:  **2024 Immigration Visa Data Table**

I'm making a data frame called "**ImmigrantVisaNumber2014**" and adding columns named "Category," "**Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad**," and "**USCIS Adjustments**", I'm putting in the data from **Fig1** into these columns.

```{r}
ImmigrantVisaNumber2014 = data.frame( 
Category = factor(c("F1", "F2A", "F2B", "F4", "E1", "E2", "E3", "E4", "E5", "DV"), levels = c("F1", "F2A", "F2B", "F4", "E1", "E2", "E3", "E4", "E5", "DV")), 
Visa_Issuances_At_Offices_Abroad = c(21511, 80041, 15137, 21931, 59140, 1680, 1880, 7088, 1489, 9228), 
USCIS_Adjustments = c(2480, 9451, 2382, 2100, 7020, 38928, 47191, 35611, 6798, 1464) 
) 
```

#### **Re-Design 1: Bar Plot with GGplot2** 

![](images/first photo.jpg){fig-align="center" width="500"}

-   Implemented the GGplot2 library to re-imagine the visualization, showcasing a bar plot utilizing the given data values.

The initial graph used a 3D model, which can sometimes be confusing and make it challenging for viewers to understand the data. The redesigned graph, now in a simpler 2D format, is clearer and more user-friendly..

I made a change in the Redesign1 by using **Plotly library** and **Position = 'dodge'** and **width** of the bars are **0.7** to compare 'Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad' and 'USCIS Adjustments' more effectively. In the initial design, I found a bit of difficulty in understanding the bar representing 'Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad,' so I placed both bars side by side to enhance clarity and better comprehend the comparison

. After redesigning the graph with Plotly, I've made it more user-friendly and easy to understand for everyone.

**Fig3: Redesigned Graph (using Plotly)**

#### Why i used Bar Plot: 

1.  **Visual Comparison:** Bar graphs facilitate easy comparison between categories.

2.  **Enhanced Clarity:** Adjusting bar width and using a dodge position improves visual distinction.

3.  **Improved Comprehension:** Side-by-side bars clarify the comparison between "Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad" and "USCIS Adjustments."

#### **Re-Design 2: Line Plot with GGplot2** 

I'm examining the visa trends for the year 2024, specifically focusing on the counts for 'Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad' and 'USCIS Adjustments.' By analyzing these columns individually, I aim to gain insights into the distribution and trends of visas issued in each category for the specified year.

#### Why i used line graph : 

1.  **Trend Analysis:** Line graphs are used to understand trends over time or categories.

2.  **Data Range:** Effective for displaying wide-ranging values in the graph

3.  **Comparative Analysis:** Separate graphs enable direct comparison between "Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad" and "USCIS Adjustments."

#### **Re-Design 3: Bubble Plot**

**Fig4: Redesigned Graph (using Plotly)**

#### why i used Bubble Plot: 

1.  **Visualizing Relationships**: Bubble plots efficiently illustrate the correlation between variables, aiding in understanding the data's interconnections.

2.  **Assessing Magnitude**: Bubble size directly represents the strength of the relationship, providing a clear indication of its significance within the data set.

3.  **Spotting Outlines**: Notable data points are easily spotted through the presence of larger bubbles, enabling swift identification of outlines in the data set.
