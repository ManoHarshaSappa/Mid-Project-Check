Additionally, I plan to visualize the data in various graphs to check if any new information emerges beyond my current understanding.\n\n**The SAS website gave me the original data for \"Immigrant Visa Number Use by Category Fiscal Year 2014:**\n\n![](images/visas_table_orig (1).png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"500\"}\n\n##### Fig1:  **2024 Immigration Visa Data Table**\n\nI'm making a data frame called \"**ImmigrantVisaNumber2014**\" and adding columns named \"Category,\" \"**Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad**,\" and \"**USCIS Adjustments**\", I'm putting in the data from **Fig1** into these columns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nImmigrantVisaNumber2014 = data.frame( \nCategory = factor(c(\"F1\", \"F2A\", \"F2B\", \"F4\", \"E1\", \"E2\", \"E3\", \"E4\", \"E5\", \"DV\"), levels = c(\"F1\", \"F2A\", \"F2B\", \"F4\", \"E1\", \"E2\", \"E3\", \"E4\", \"E5\", \"DV\")), \nVisa_Issuances_At_Offices_Abroad = c(21511, 80041, 15137, 21931, 59140, 1680, 1880, 7088, 1489, 9228), \nUSCIS_Adjustments = c(2480, 9451, 2382, 2100, 7020, 38928, 47191, 35611, 6798, 1464) \n) \n```\n:::\n\n\n#### **Re-Design 1: Bar Plot with GGplot2** \n\n![](images/first photo.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"500\"}\n\n-   Implemented the GGplot2 library to re-imagine the visualization, showcasing a bar plot utilizing the given data values.\n\nThe initial graph used a 3D model, which can sometimes be confusing and make it challenging for viewers to understand the data. The redesigned graph, now in a simpler 2D format, is clearer and more user-friendly..\n\nI made a change in the Redesign1 by using **Plotly library** and **Position = 'dodge'** and **width** of the bars are **0.7** to compare 'Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad' and 'USCIS Adjustments' more effectively. In the initial design, I found a bit of difficulty in understanding the bar representing 'Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad,' so I placed both bars side by side to enhance clarity and better comprehend the comparison\n\n. After redesigning the graph with Plotly, I've made it more user-friendly and easy to understand for everyone.\n\n![](images/1 .png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"700\"}\n\n**Fig3: Redesigned Graph (using Plotly)**\n\n#### Why i used Bar Plot: \n\n1.  **Visual Comparison:** Bar graphs facilitate easy comparison between categories.\n\n2.  **Enhanced Clarity:** Adjusting bar width and using a dodge position improves visual distinction.\n\n3.  **Improved Comprehension:** Side-by-side bars clarify the comparison between \"Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad\" and \"USCIS Adjustments.\"\n\n#### **Re-Design 2: Line Plot with GGplot2** \n\nI'm examining the visa trends for the year 2024, specifically focusing on the counts for 'Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad' and 'USCIS Adjustments.' By analyzing these columns individually, I aim to gain insights into the distribution and trends of visas issued in each category for the specified year.\n\n![](images/redesign2.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n**Fig4: Redesigned Graph (using Plotly)**\n\n#### Why i used line graph : \n\n1.  **Trend Analysis:** Line graphs are used to understand trends over time or categories.\n\n2.  **Data Range:** Effective for displaying wide-ranging values in the graph\n\n3.  **Comparative Analysis:** Separate graphs enable direct comparison between \"Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad\" and \"USCIS Adjustments.\"\n\n#### **Re-Design 3: Bubble Plot**\n\n![](images/point.png)\n\n**Fig4: Redesigned Graph (using Plotly)**\n\n#### why i used Bubble Plot: \n\n1.  **Visualizing Relationships**: Bubble plots efficiently illustrate the correlation between variables, aiding in understanding the data's interconnections.\n\n2.  **Assessing Magnitude**: Bubble size directly represents the strength of the relationship, providing a clear indication of its significance within the data set.\n\n3.  **Spotting Outlines**: Notable data points are easily spotted through the presence of larger bubbles, enabling swift identification of outlines in the data set.\n",
