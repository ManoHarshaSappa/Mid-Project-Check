    "text": "I want to make a bad graph better using what I know. I aim to create a perfect and easily understandable graph. Additionally, I plan to visualize the data in various graphs to check if any new information emerges beyond my current understanding.\nThe SAS website gave me the original data for “Immigrant Visa Number Use by Category Fiscal Year 2014:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig1: 2024 Immigration Visa Data Table\nI’m making a data frame called “ImmigrantVisaNumber2014” and adding columns named “Category,” “Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad,” and “USCIS Adjustments”, I’m putting in the data from Fig1 into these columns.\n\nImmigrantVisaNumber2014 = data.frame( \nCategory = factor(c(\"F1\", \"F2A\", \"F2B\", \"F4\", \"E1\", \"E2\", \"E3\", \"E4\", \"E5\", \"DV\"), levels = c(\"F1\", \"F2A\", \"F2B\", \"F4\", \"E1\", \"E2\", \"E3\", \"E4\", \"E5\", \"DV\")), \nVisa_Issuances_At_Offices_Abroad = c(21511, 80041, 15137, 21931, 59140, 1680, 1880, 7088, 1489, 9228), \nUSCIS_Adjustments = c(2480, 9451, 2382, 2100, 7020, 38928, 47191, 35611, 6798, 1464) \n) \n\n\n\nRe-Design 1: Bar Plot with GGplot2\n\nImplemented the GGplot2 library to re-imagine the visualization, showcasing a bar plot utilizing the given data values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe initial graph used a 3D model, which can sometimes be confusing and make it challenging for viewers to understand the data. The redesigned graph, now in a simpler 2D format, is clearer and more user-friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\nI made a change in the Redesign1 by using Plotly library and Position = ‘dodge’ and width of the bars are 0.7 to compare ‘Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad’ and ‘USCIS Adjustments’ more effectively. In the initial design, I found a bit of difficulty in understanding the bar representing ‘Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad,’ so I placed both bars side by side to enhance clarity and better comprehend the comparison\n. After redesigning the graph with Plotly, I’ve made it more user-friendly and easy to understand for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nFig3: Redesigned Graph (using Plotly)\n\n\nWhy i used Bar Plot:\n\nVisual Comparison: Bar graphs facilitate easy comparison between categories.\nEnhanced Clarity: Adjusting bar width and using a dodge position improves visual distinction.\nImproved Comprehension: Side-by-side bars clarify the comparison between “Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad” and “USCIS Adjustments.”\n\n\n\nRe-Design 2: Line Plot with GGplot2\nI’m examining the visa trends for the year 2024, specifically focusing on the counts for ‘Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad’ and ‘USCIS Adjustments.’ By analyzing these columns individually, I aim to gain insights into the distribution and trends of visas issued in each category for the specified year.\n\n\n\n\n\nFig4: Redesigned Graph (using Plotly)\n\n\nWhy i used line graph :\n\nTrend Analysis: Line graphs are used to understand trends over time or categories.\nData Range: Effective for displaying wide-ranging values in the graph\nComparative Analysis: Separate graphs enable direct comparison between “Visa Issuances at Offices Abroad” and “USCIS Adjustments.”\n\n\n\nRe-Design 3: Scatter Plot\nAfter making this plot, I see the patterns and trends in the values. I understand how strong the relationship is and how the values are spread out. In the plot, the big marked points have high values. There are two colors: blue and red. I used the scatter plot to see how Visa Issuance and USCIS Adjustments relate to each other and how strong that relationship is.\n\nFig4: Redesigned Graph (using Plotly)\n\n\nwhy i used Scatter Plot:\n\nRelationship Analysis: Scatter plots visualize relationships between two variables.\nStrength Assessment: Spread of points indicates the strength of the relationship.\nIdentification of Outliers: High-value points highlight notable instances in the data."
